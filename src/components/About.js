            Hi, my name is Aranya and I enjoy solving puzzles, building things,
            and exploring technology. My journey began in 2015 when I became
            fascinated by <span className="highlight">remote-controlled cars</span> and
            microcontrollers like <span className="highlight">Arduino and ESP</span>. That
            childhood curiosity sparked a lifelong passion for electronics and
            robotics.
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[1] = el)}>
            From 2015 to 2019, I explored the vast fields of computer science,
            graphics design, and software engineering. During the pandemic, I
            deep-dived into{" "}
            <span className="highlight">Web Development and Figma Design</span>.
            My academic journey eventually led me to United International
            University, after receiving 19 admission offers from universities in
            the <span className="highlight">USA and Switzerland</span>.
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[2] = el)}>
            In 2024, I pivoted my focus toward{" "}
            <span className="highlight">
              Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
            </span>
            . Today, I serve as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at UIU, a
            Teaching Assistant for IoT and Robotics, and the{" "}
            <span className="highlight">President of the UIU Robotics Club</span>,
            where I continue to push the boundaries of intelligent systems.
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[4] = el)}>
            Outside of work, I love playing video games. I'm also into aesthetic
            interior designs and I love hoarding cool tech products.
