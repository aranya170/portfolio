            Hi, my name is Aranya and I enjoy fiddling with numbers and solving
            problems. My interest in CS started back in 2016 when I was just in
            the junior school. I was fascinated by a remote control car. I
            wanted to know how it worked, so I took it apart and tried to put it
            back together. That curiosity led me to explore coding.
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[1] = el)}>
            Since then, Iâ€™ve earned a degree in Computer Science Engineering
            from the United International University, where I specialized in and
            built a strong foundation in{" "}
            <span className="highlight">
              Data Science, Python, Design and Software Development
            </span>
            . For me, computer science is not just about writing code; it's
            about understanding how technology can solve real-world problems and
            make life easier.
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[2] = el)}>
            I have a strong appetite for learning and I'm always eager to
            explore new technologies. This website is a testament to my journey
            where I picked up{" "}
            <span className="highlight">Tailwind, React & JavaScript</span>{" "}
            along the way. I also have a background in{" "}
            <span className="highlight"> Graphic Design. </span>
          </p>

          <p ref={(el) => (textRefs.current[4] = el)}>
            Outside of work, I love playing video games. I'm also into aesthetic
            interior designs and I love hoarding cool tech products.
